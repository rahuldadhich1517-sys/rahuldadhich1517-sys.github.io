    longDescription: `
The Chatbot was developed as an AI-assisted solution to help Case Managers handle and resolve case inquiries more efficiently.

One of the key technical challenges was implementing secure authentication using Azure services. I researched and implemented Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory) to provide seamless and secure authentication for users.

After researching, testing, and integrating the authentication flow, the chatbot was successfully rolled out without downtime. This project strengthened my understanding of Azure services, secure authentication, and solving unfamiliar technical challenges through research and experimentation.

One of my biggest achievements on this project was improving application performance. When I joined the project, multiple React components were making the same API calls independently, causing redundant network requests and slower page loading.

I analyzed the issue and suggested migrating the state management architecture to Redux Toolkit. I centralized API calls, cached shared data in the Redux store, and updated components to consume shared state instead of making separate requests.

As a result, redundant API calls were significantly reduced and data fetching performance improved by approximately 25%. This was especially meaningful because the improvement directly enhanced the user experience of a production application used by real customers.

    longDescription: `
The Activate Everyware Chatbot project focused on building a visual chatbot builder that enables companies to design and manage custom conversational flows.

Using React Flow, I created a node-based drag-and-drop canvas where users can visually build chatbot conversations.

I also implemented conditional logic within the conversational nodes, allowing businesses to define dynamic question-and-answer flows based on different user responses and conditions.

The result was a flexible and customisable visual tool that makes it easier for companies to design complex chatbot workflows without manually defining every flow through code.
